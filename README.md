NLP on Characters

This repository contains code to combine all text files from folders into one master text file combined.txt and then store the male and female lines in spearate files.
Further, I have done Sentiment Analysis using Textblob and NLTK to find top and bottom 10 sentences for both male and female based on sentiment polarity and the most common descriptor words along with their frequency.
